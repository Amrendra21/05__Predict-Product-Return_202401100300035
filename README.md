📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will return a product using machine learning techniques. Returns have a significant impact on e-commerce platforms in terms of revenue, logistics, and customer satisfaction. By analyzing key features like price, ratings, and delivery time, we can build a predictive model to help reduce unnecessary returns and improve business operations.

📊 Key Results
Achieved a good classification accuracy in predicting product returns.

Top predictors of returns:

Price – higher-priced items tend to get returned more

Delivery Time – delays increase return probability

Rating – low-rated products are more likely to be returned


🔍 Future Enhancements
Include more features like customer demographics and product category

Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost or Neural Networks
